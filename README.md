### Hi, I'm Prarthana!
💻 SWE at Google Cambridge on the Cloud Monitoring team <br /> <br />
📚 B.S. CS, B.A. Math, Minor in Music from Case Western <br /> <br />
🖼️ Nowadays, I use my github for personal projects! Right now, I'm paying around with 🕺 vibe coding 💃 <br /> <br />
🌱 Check out my senior project at SylvieDyer/SeniorProject. My team won first place for engineering at the Case Western Intersections poster presentation! <br /> <br />
🎺 Also check out Tuni, an IOT application to help tune instruments. It connects an iOS application to detect an instrument's pitch, and a raspberry pi controlled lamp to provide visual feedback. <br /> <br />
