### Hi, I'm Prarthana!
📚 Senior at Case Western Reserve University, where I major in Computer Science and Math <br /> <br />
🖼️ I'm also minoring in music, and in my free time, I love to play the piano <br /> <br />
🌱 Check out my senior project at SylvieDyer/SeniorProject. My team won first place for engineering at the Case Western Intersections poster presentation! <br /> <br />
🎺 Right now, I'm working on Tuni, an IOT application to help tune instruments. It connects an iOS application to detect an instrument's pitch, and a raspberry pi controlled lamp to provide visual feedback. <br /> <br />
